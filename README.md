Follow these guidelines to execute the code.

Project 1 - Decision Tree Algorithm Project.zip
1. Download the folder and locate the .png files. The output results are stored there.
2. The source code can be found at Decision Tree Algorithm Project\Decision Tree CART.py.
3. To run the program, download the latest Python interpreter from the official website: http://python.org/downloads/release/python-3143/
5. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2026 Community or any other IDE to run the program.
6. For best compatibility, efficiency, accessibility, and faster processing, it is recommended to use PyCharm.
7. After installing the Python interpreter, open the settings of your IDE and create a Python virtual environment to manage scripts and packages separately.
8. The IDE will automatically detect available Python interpreters; select the latest version.
9. If you encounter issues with the latest interpreter, use a lower version instead.
10. Install all required packages before running the program. This can be done via the terminal within the virtual environment using pip or pip3.
11. Some IDEs may automatically prompt you to install missing packages when running the program, depending on the software used.
12. Alternatively, you can use the PyPI interface to search for and install required packages directly for faster setup.
13. After installing the required packages, update the CSV file path or directory in the code to match the location of your dataset (Line 16 of the code)
14. Once everything is set up, run the program.

Project 2 - Data Analysis Project.R
1. This file must be executed sequentially, line by line, in RStudio. Avoid running the entire script at once, as this may cause execution errors.
2. Other IDEs such as Microsoft Visual Studio 2026 Community or Visual Studio Code can be used; however, they require additional configuration and may lead to compatibility issues.
3. This code involves Machine Learning and Deep Learning model training, which requires high RAM capacity and significant computational resources. Running the script on low-spec machines may result in slow performance or failures.
4. Ensure that all required libraries are installed. You can install them via the Packages panel on the right-hand side of RStudio by searching for the package names. Alternatively, when executing library() calls, RStudio will prompt you to install any missing packages automatically.
5. For Machine Learning and Deep Learning functionality using Keras and TensorFlow, install Python interpreter version 3.10 or lower to avoid compatibility issues with newer versions.
6. Recommended version: Python 3.10.11: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/
7. No manual interpreter configuration is required; RStudio will automatically detect the installed Python version when running the code.
8. For lines 34 and 37, ensure that the file paths are updated to match your own local directory.
9. Once these steps are completed, execute the code sequentially to ensure successful execution.
