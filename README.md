Follow these guidelines to execute the code.

Project 1 - Decision Tree Algorithm Project.zip
1. Download and unzip the folder and locate the .png files. The output results are stored there.
2. If you want to read the raw code without executing it, you can click on 
3. To run the program, download the latest Python interpreter from the official website: http://python.org/downloads/release/python-3143/
4. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2026 Community or any other IDE to run the program.
5. For best compatibility, efficiency, accessibility, and faster processing, it is recommended to use PyCharm.
6. After installing the Python interpreter, open the settings of your IDE and create a Python virtual environment to manage scripts and packages separately.
7. The IDE will automatically detect available Python interpreters; select the latest version.
8. If you encounter issues with the latest interpreter, use a lower version instead.
9. Install all required packages before running the program. This can be done via the terminal within the virtual environment using pip or pip3.
10. Some IDEs may automatically prompt you to install missing packages when running the program, depending on the software used.
11. Alternatively, you can use the PyPI interface to search for and install required packages directly for faster setup.
12. After installing the required packages, update the CSV file path or directory in the code to match the location of your dataset. (Line 16 of the code)
13. Once everything is set up, run the program.
